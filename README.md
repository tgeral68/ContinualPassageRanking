# ContinualPassageRanking

Repository for the paper "Continual Learning of Long Topic Sequences in Neural Information Retrieval". In this repository you will find the code for generating the long sequences topics/tasks. 


## Dataset
Dataset can be generated based on their topics using a sentence bert pretrained model (see [dataset documentation](lire/dataset.md)). We also provide the three set used in the associated paper.


## Training model
In the following we describe the different approaches tested in successively fine-tunning model.
